## Source
Original Source: [https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18)

## Abstract
Share contextual information with language models Expose tools and capabilities to AI systems This dossier treats the material as an advanced-level knowledge and cross-checks it against corroborating sources.

## Context and Problem Framing
The source frames the problem around Specification, ​Overview, ​Key Details, ​Base Protocol. Expose tools and capabilities to AI systems Build composable integrations and workflows

## Technical Approach
The synthesis compares claims across the primary source and additional references, then normalizes them into a systems-level narrative. Hosts: LLM applications that initiate connections Clients: Connectors within the host application Servers: Services that provide context and capabilities

## Main Findings
Share contextual information with language models Expose tools and capabilities to AI systems Build composable integrations and workflows Server and client capability negotiation Resources: Context and data, for the user or the AI model to use

## Critical Analysis
Prompts: Templated messages and workflows for users Tools: Functions for the AI model to execute Conflicting assumptions across sources should be resolved through targeted experiments before production adoption.

## Application to This Cookbook
In this cookbook, this dossier should be connected to [[02_Agents/Agents Index]], [[01_MOCs/Agents MOC]], and [[02_Agents/06_Knowledge/Knowledge Index]]. Use this note as a foundation for implementation logs, benchmark deltas, and architecture decisions.
